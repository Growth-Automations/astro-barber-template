We started GrowthAutomations in 2012 with a simple philosophy: attention to detail matters. After years of applying that mindset to other industries, we realized there was a gap in the grooming market — precision barbering for people who appreciate craftsmanship.

In 2019, we opened GrowthAutomations Barbershop — applying the same systematic standards to fades, beard sculpts, and hot towel treatments.

Our team takes pride in:

- Delivering precision cuts with clean lines, every time
- Using premium products sourced from the best suppliers
- Creating a welcoming shop experience for clients of all style preferences
- Supporting our community through events, mentorship, and fresh cuts for first interviews
