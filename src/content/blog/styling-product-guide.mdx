## Fine hair

Reach for lightweight powder or sea salt spray to add volume without weigh-down. Work from roots outward, then finish with a low-shine paste.

## Thick or textured hair

Cream pomades and hydration oils keep definition while controlling frizz. Use a dime-sized amount and diffuse or air-dry.

## All-day hold

Clays are your friend. Warm the product in your palms, apply to dry hair, and finish with a burst of Texture Mist for movement. Holds strong all day.
