## Refresh the neckline

Use a detail trimmer or guarded clipper to soften growth along your neckline. Work in small passes and follow the natural curve so you maintain that clean shop finish. Small, consistent touch-ups keep you looking sharp.

## Moisturize daily

Hydrated hair blends more smoothly. After showers, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner and brush with the growth pattern. Make it part of your daily routine.

## Schedule micro visits

GrowthAutomations offers 15-minute tidy sessions for members. Pop in for a quick taper touch-up and beard line clean to stay camera ready. Quick maintenance, big difference.
