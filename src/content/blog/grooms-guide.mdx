## Seven days out

Lock in your final cut and beard sculpt. This gives hair a few days to settle while looking sharp for rehearsal events.

## Two days out

Book the steam facial and brow tidy session. It reduces redness and keeps skin photo-ready.

## Wedding morning

Let our lounge team handle touch-ups, scalp treatments, and styling product recommendations so you walk into first look feeling composed and camera-ready.
